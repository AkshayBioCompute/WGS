# WGS Bioinformatics Pipeline

This repository contains a bioinformatics pipeline for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis. The pipeline processes sequencing data through various stages including quality control, alignment, duplicate marking, and base quality recalibration using common bioinformatics tools such as FastQC, BWA, and GATK.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline consists of the following key steps:

1. **Quality Control (FastQC)**:
   - Runs FastQC on the raw FASTQ files to assess the quality of the sequencing data.

2. **Sequence Alignment (BWA-MEM)**:
   - Aligns the sequencing reads to the reference genome using BWA-MEM.
   
3. **Duplicate Marking (GATK MarkDuplicatesSpark)**:
   - Marks duplicate reads to avoid bias in downstream analysis.

4. **Base Quality Score Recalibration (GATK BaseRecalibrator and ApplyBQSR)**:
   - Recalibrates the base quality scores of the reads using known sites of variation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, ensure the following tools are installed:

- **FastQC**: For quality control of sequencing reads.
- **BWA**: For sequence alignment to a reference genome.
- **GATK**: For variant processing and quality recalibration.
- **Python 3.x**: For running the pipeline script and automating the workflow.

### Required Libraries
To install the necessary Python libraries, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- `subprocess32` (Optional, for Python 2.x compatibility)
- `numpy`, `pandas` (optional for data manipulation)

### External Tools

Ensure the following tools are available in your system's PATH:

- **FastQC**: Download and install from [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).
- **BWA**: Download and install from [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/).
- **GATK**: Download and install from [GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us).

## Configuration

### File Paths
The script assumes the following directory structure for the files:

- **Reference genome**: `hg38.fa.gz`
- **Known sites VCF**: `Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dbsnp138.vcf`
- **Aligned reads**: `/aligned_reads/`
- **Raw reads**: `/reads/`
- **Results**: `/results/`
- **Temporary data**: `/data/`

### Example Path Definitions in `WGS.py`

```python
ref = "/home/akshay/Akshay/WGS/hg38.fa.gz"
known_sites_vcf = "/home/akshay/Akshay/WGS/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dbsnp138.vcf"
aligned_reads = "/home/akshay/Akshay/WGS/aligned_reads"
reads = "/home/akshay/Akshay/WGS/reads"
results = "/home/akshay/Akshay/WGS/results"
data = "/home/akshay/Akshay/WGS/data"
```

Modify these paths as needed to fit your data's location.

## Running the Pipeline

Once the setup is complete, you can run the pipeline by executing the main Python script:

```bash
python src/WGS.py
```

The pipeline will perform the following steps:
1. Quality control with FastQC on the provided FASTQ files.
2. Alignment using BWA-MEM.
3. Mark duplicates using GATK's `MarkDuplicatesSpark`.
4. Apply base quality score recalibration using GATK's `BaseRecalibrator` and `ApplyBQSR`.
